- Open Survey folder in vs code
- Open vs code terminal and create a virtual environment: python3 -m venv Survey-venv
- Activate the virtual environment: source Survey-venv/bin/activate
- To get out of this virtual environment: deactivate
- The default python inside this environment is python3
- Install django: python -m pip install django
- Check django version: django-admin --version
- Create the core project: django-admin startproject core
- Rename the core folder to Survey-dev
- Go into the Survey-dev directory to find the manage.py file and core app
- Created an app named polls, 'python manage.py startapp polls'
- Created admin super user, 'python manage.py createsuperuser'

- To setup PostgreSQL, download it from its official website, you will get PGAdmin with the installer.
- Make the neccessary changes in core project's Settings.py file for database Settings.py
- Install psycopg2, installation will fail inside virtual environment as 'pg_config' is not a part of PATH environment variable:
    - open Terminal, find pg_config by: sudo find / -name pg_config
    - once you find the location, add to the PATH in the virtual environment : export PATH={location}:$PATH 
    - install psycopg2 in the virtual environment: pip install psycopg2
    - do all the above sub steps inside the virtual environment
- Upgrade pip in virtual environment: python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip   
- Install Pillow next, in the virtual environment: python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
- We need to migrate the database to PostgreSQL next by running:
    - python manage.py makemigrations
    - python manage.py migrate
- Open PGAdmin, go to Database the Schemas then Tables
